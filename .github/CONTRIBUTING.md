# Contributing

## Finding something do to.

Browse all issues (bugs and feature requests). Find something that you would like to help with. Comment the issue and say that you are working on it.

If you would like to contribute with something that doesn't exist, create a new issue and then comment on it.

## Making changes

* Create a feature branch from where you want to base your work.
* Make commits of logical units (i.e. working features).
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Write meaningful commit messages.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Make sure that you're "all green in reshaper" (or make sure that you have formatted your code reasonable well).

## Tests.

There are not that many unit tests yet, however our ultimate goal is to have complete coverage. Therefore all contributions must be covered by tests.

* Repositories should have integration tests where the queries and mappings are tested.
* Business logic should be covered by unit tests

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a feature branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to this repository
